Created using FreeCAD v0.15. G-code for lazy ones is included too, but keep in mind: 
there are 230°C hot end temperature and 115°C G-code included, for mine ABS 1.75 mm.

Holes for screws are only 1.8 mm diam, because it is more simple to drill exact diam for screws you will use instead of correcting CAD file. But if you would like to change something, you are free to do it.
